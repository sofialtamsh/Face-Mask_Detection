# Face Mask Detection using Keras and TensorFlow

This project is a deep learning-based face mask detection system implemented using **Keras** and **TensorFlow**. The model is trained to classify images into two categories: with mask and without mask. It uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier with the **ReLU activation function** to effectively detect face masks in real-time.

## Project Overview

In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, wearing face masks was become crucial for public safety. The objective of this project was to create a reliable, fast, and efficient system that detects whether people are wearing masks in real-time through video or images.

The project focuses on:
- **Image classification** to identify the presence of a mask.
- **Real-time detection** using webcam or video feed.

## Features

- Trained on a diverse dataset containing images with and without face masks.
- Uses a CNN model built with TensorFlow and Keras.
- Achieves high accuracy in detecting face masks.
- Real-time mask detection using a video feed or static image inputs.
- Simple and efficient model with the **ReLU activation function**.
